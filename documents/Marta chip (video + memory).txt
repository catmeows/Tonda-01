Video timing
Each frame 311 lines are generated.
Frame starts with 71 lines, either sync or border.
Next 176 lines with pixels are generated.
And finaly, 64 border lines of border follows.

Each line takes 114 cycles.
First 22 cycles are sync and backporch, followed by 92 cycles of picture area. We can expect that about 85 cycles would be really visible on TV.

SYNC(22)   |               PICTURE(92)                         |
invisible(25) |             visible(85)                 |inv(4)| 
SYNC(22)   | BORDER(6) |    320/160 PIXELS(80)    | BORDER(6)  |   

Interrupts
IRQ is kept low for cycles 0 to 19 at the beginning of frame.
If FIRQ register is not disabled, then it will be triggered at line given FCNT register 
FIRQ is kept low for cycle 0 to 19.
As interrupt lines are kept low for 4 cycles, SYNC instruction can be used to wait for inttterupt.

Memory refresh
Marta will refresh DRAM on each line, accessing 16 rows in first 16 cycles of line. That secures refresh cycle for 256 rows every 1 ms.
