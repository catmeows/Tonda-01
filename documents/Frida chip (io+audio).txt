I/O

KEYBOARD AND JOYSTICK

Keyboard and both joysticks are read in serial fashion, via 4021 shift register.
Latch line (PB5) is connected to P/S pin of 4021. When latch goes hi, parallel mode is selected and state of buttons is latched.
Then, latch line goes low and serial mode is selected.
Q7 of 4021 is connected to (keyboard/joystick0/joystick1) serial data in (PB2/PB3/PB4).
PB6 is connected to 4021's CLOCK. This way, whenever PB6 goes hi, latched bits are shifted to next position.
This way is possible to read up to 8 buttons.
To save Fridas pin count, latch and clock are common for keyboard and both joysticks.

Since keyboard has much more buttons, key row is selected by 3 to 8 decoder.


KEYBOARD
Tonda 01 has 56 key keyboards, organized as matrix of 8 rows of 7 buttons.


Physical layout looks like this

JOYSTICK

Joystick has buttons up, down, left, right, fire 1, fire 2, fire 3.

Reading joystick:
 1) Write to SELECT ($BFE0) $03 (select PORTC)
 2) Read REGISTER ($BFE1) and mask bits 2,3,4,5,6 - saving bit 0 (printer busy), bit 1 (tape out), bit 7 (caps lock led)
 3) Write to REGISTER ($BFE1) combine saved bits with serial latch low, serial clock low
 4) Write to REGISTER ($BFE1) again, now with latch bit (b5) set hi - buttons are latched.
 5) Write to SELECT ($BFE0) $02 (select PORTB)
 6) Read REGISTER (($BFE1), bit 3 (bit 4) is state of button on joystick 0 (joystick 1)
 7) Write to SELECT ($BFE0) $03 (select PORTC)
 8) Write to REGISTER ($BFE1), with serial clock hi - button bits are shifted by one
 9) Write to REGISTER ($BFE1), with serial clock low
 10) Go back to step 5) and repeat until all button states are collected



 
PARALLEL PORT (PRINTER)

Parallel port has connected 8 data lines, /STROBE signal, BUSY signal. Data lines are bidirectional.


TAPE IN/OUT



AUDIO
Frida provides 4 channels: A, B, C, D
Channels A,B are mixed together as first output and C,D are mixed together as second audio output. In normal circumstancies, these two audio lines are connected to internal speaker.  
Connecting 3.5mm stereo jack into AUDIO connector disables internal speaker. In such case, channels A,B are routed to left output and channels C,D are routed to right output.

Each channel is controlled by 4 registers:
FREQHI - NVVVFFFF - N..noise on/off, VVV..volume 0..7, FFFF..high 4 bits of frequency
FREQLO - low 8 bit of frequency
WAVEHI - high wave sample 
WAVELO - low wave sample 

FREQHI - channel control and 4 bits of frequency (pitch) control
FREQLO - lower 8 bits of frequency (pitch) control (write to FREQLO is latched and loaded when FREQHI is written)
WAVEHI - high wave form bits
WAVELO - low wave form bits (write to WAVELO is latched and loaded when WAVEHI is written)

FREQL and FREQH forms frequency divider (higher value means lower frequency/tone pitch) that gives pace at which two wave register, WAVEL and WAVEH registers are shifted.
When frequency is zero the clock is stopped
Most significant bits of WAVEL and WAVEH forms value 0..3 that gives output level for the particular channel.
This output level is multiplied by value VVV from FREQHI register.
When N bit is reset, most significant bit shifted out from WAVEL/WAVEH register and is put into bit 0. Effectively, the values in WAVEL/WAVEH registers are rotated.
When N bit is set, the shift register is turned into linear feedback register producing pseudorandom stream of bits.

To set a channel
1) select channel by writting to CONTROL ($BFE0) bits b1-b0 (......CC), channel to be written is indicated by bit set
2) set WAVELO ($BFE7), WAVEHI ($BFE6) 
   e.g. to set triangle wave 
   3 ..X.....
   2 .XXX....
   1 XXXXX...
   
   WAVEL = %10101000 
   WAVEH = %01110000
   
3) write lower 8 bits of frequency to FREQLO ($BFE5) 
4) write higher 4 bits of frequency, noise mode and volume to FREQHI ($BFE34).
   Bits are as follows: NVVVFFFF - N..noise, VVV..volume, FFFF..frequency
            
   pitch = 1.7734475 / (2 * 8 * FREQ)
   
   FREQ = 1.7734475 / (2 * 8 * pitch)
