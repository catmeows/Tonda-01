FOR-TO-STEP
FOR -> put FOR structure on data stack: varid, limit, step, adress of next line after FOR

IF-ELSE-ENDIF
IF -> put IF structure and set true/false flag
IF -> branch taken: continue to next command
IF -> branch skipped: find ELSE or ENDIF on same level
ELSE -> check IF structure, if branch taken, find ENDIF on same level and discard IF structure
ENDIF -> check IF structure, discard IF

DO-WHILE-REPEAT
DO -> put DO structure on data stack: address of next line after DO, address of next line after REPEAT (default unknown)
WHILE -> branch taken, check DO structure, continue to next command
WHILE -> branch skipped, check DO structure, if 
EXIT -> check DO structure, if it has REPEAT address, use it otherwise find REPEAT
REPEAT -> check DO structure, if the REPEAT address is empty put it into DO structure, jump to line after DO
